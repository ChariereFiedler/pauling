EMAIL_PUBLISH_PLAIN_TEXT = """Hello,

Thanks for promoting your poster "{title}" with Pauling!

Be sure to add the QR code to your poster before printing it:

- Download the PNG version: {png_url}
- Download the SVG version: {svg_url}

We have created a *public* page for your poster and you can view it at:
{public_url}.

Your QR code redirects to this page. The users of the Pauling iPhone/Android
application can directly view your poster in high definition and have access to
the information you supplied. This should boost your research!

You can edit these information at any time by using the following *private* link:
{admin_url}.

Cheers,
Your friends at TailorDev (https://tailordev.fr/)

PS: You receive this email because you have asked Pauling to do so :)
